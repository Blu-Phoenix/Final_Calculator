# Final_Calculator

Hello, this is a little program I put togather before my finals to help me prioritize which test to study for. You can run this program in a simple python idle and enter your information through the prompts. 

All the program does is ask you questions about your class and then calculate the score you have to make on the final to achieve your desired score.
